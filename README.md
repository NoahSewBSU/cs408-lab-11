# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This project demonstrates the GET, PUT, and DELETE functions within an API. This connects to a remote service which can be manipulated to store, delete, and retrieve data.

This process requires HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Update your IDE with the latest versions of these. I personally used Live Preview on VS Code when developing the demo.

Then, using a browser of your choosing or applying Live Preview, test the buttons by adding objects of your own.
